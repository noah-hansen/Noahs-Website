                    <h4>My Experience:</h4>
                <p>
                    Driving around Iceland was an absolute adventure with my father. As we ate our pasta and struggled to get some good sleep, spriting around 
                    these amazing towns was incredible! We made it a goal to try to run all of the hikes we could in order to fit more sceneic stops in during
                    our 6-day trip around the island. Talking together at the lighthouse in Husavik has become one of our most cherished memories.

                <p>
                    Over the last few years, the popularity of Iceland has exploded. With the increase in social media usage and modern photography, the once-hidden
                    island continues to gain fame around the world. Below are some of the statistical recordings of recent international tourism to the island.

                <p>
                    As the heart of the North Island of New Zealand, the Waikato region beckons with its lush green landscapes and rich cultural heritage. Home 
                    to the mighty Waikato River, the longest in the country, this region boasts enchanting natural wonders such as the spellbinding Waitomo 
                    Caves, where luminescent glowworms illuminate the subterranean caverns. Journeying south to the breathtaking mountain ranges of the 
                    South Island, one is greeted by a tapestry of rugged peaks, tranquil lakes, and verdant valleys. Here, adventurers can explore the iconic 
                    Southern Alps, offering thrilling outdoor pursuits amidst awe-inspiring scenery. Among these majestic peaks lies the crown jewel of 
                    Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park, where the tallest mountain in New Zealand, Aoraki/Mount Cook, towers over a pristine alpine landscape. 
                    With its glistening glaciers, turquoise lakes, and pristine wilderness, this park is a haven for hikers, mountaineers, and nature 
                    enthusiasts alike, inviting visitors to immerse themselves in the unparalleled beauty of the Southern Alps.

                    <h4>My Experience:</h4>
                <p>
                    As a family we had the absolute privilege of living in New Zealand for a period of about 25 months. The amazing scenery and natural 
                    beauty of the country really brought our entire family together as we set off to explore what we could together. Some of my favorite 
                    pictures are encompassed in these pictures, specifically visiting the film location of ‘Hobbiton’ from ‘The Lord of the Rings’. As we 
                    drove in that day, I remember that special feeling as tears rolled down my face. I hope to never forget all the wonderful people and 
                    experiences that we had in our short time there. It truly changed the way I view others and shaped my love for the outdoors. Life 
                    really can be whatever you make it.

                    The Western United States is a realm of unparalleled natural beauty, where rugged landscapes and majestic vistas captivate the 
                    imagination. Bryce Canyon National Park stands as a testament to the forces of nature, with its towering hoodoos and sweeping 
                    amphitheaters offering a glimpse into the Earth's ancient past. To the east, the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains rise majestically, 
                    their rugged peaks and verdant forests providing a playground for outdoor enthusiasts in Utah's vibrant capital, Salt Lake City. 
                    Further north, the Teton Mountains in Wyoming command attention with their jagged summits and tranquil lakes, painting a picture 
                    of serenity amidst the wild frontier. Together, these iconic destinations embody the timeless allure and grandeur of the Western

                    <h4>My Experience:</h4>
                <p>
                    After arriving home from New Zealand, I was somewhat unsure of how to approach the nature of my new home; however, the passions I had recently 
                    formed from nature away from the United States couldn't have been better expressed than here in the Western States. I have enjoyed exploring the
                    local mountain ranges with my friends, visiting the surrounding national parks, and helping others to find new appreciation for their local 
                    surroundings. I am excited to continue to explore, and feel so blessed to live in a place where so many of the people arrund me are anxious to do the same. I have also recently 
                    begun an effort to visit the extensive list of local waterfalls in the Salt Lake Valley.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here below is a fun 16-minute video jounral that I made with my friends highlighting a 3-day backpacking trip through the Coyote Gulch, 
                    located in Southern Utah.

                Must remains to be seen and experienced. I am excited to continue to explore and help others to recognise the beauty around them, and I beg 
                to reckon that most will be suprised by how small the distances often are to reach it.
